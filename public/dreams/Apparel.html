                当你醒来记得自己梦见了<strong>Apparel</strong>，你的潜意识正在试图告诉你什么？<br/><br/><strong>(此条目源自英文网站，暂未翻译)</strong><br><br>.[16]Dreams of apparel, denote that enterprises will be successes or failures,as the apparel seems to be whole and clean, or soiled and threadbare.To see fine apparel, but out of date, foretells that you will have fortune,but you will scorn progressive ideas.If you reject out-of-date apparel, you will outgrow present environmentsand enter into new relations, new enterprises and new loves, which willtransform you into a different person.To see yourself or others appareled in white, denotes eventful changes,and you will nearly always find the change bearing sadness.To walk with a person wearing white, proclaims that person'sillness or distress, unless it be a young woman or child,then you will have pleasing surroundings for a season at least.To see yourself, or others, dressed in black, portends quarrels,disappointments, and disagreeable companions; or, if it refersto business, the business will fall short of expectations.To see yellow apparel, foretells approaching gaieties and financial progress.Seen as a flitting spectre, in an unnatural light, the reverse maybe expected. You will be fortunate if you dream of yellow cloth.To dream of blue apparel, signifies carrying forward to victoryyour aspirations, through energetic, insistent efforts.Friends will loyally support you.To dream of crimson apparel, foretells that you will escape formidableenemies by a timely change in your expressed intention.To see green apparel, is a hopeful sign of prosperity and happiness.To see many colored apparel, foretells swift changes, and interminglingof good and bad influences in your future.To dream of misfitting apparel, intimates crosses in your affections,and that you are likely to make a mistake in some enterprise.To see old or young in appropriate apparel, denotes that youwill undertake some engagement for which you will have no liking,and which will give rise to many cares.For a woman to dream that she is displeased with her apparel,foretells that she will find many vexatious rivalries in her questfor social distinction.To admire the apparel of others, denotes that she will have jealousfears of her friends.To dream of the loss of any article of apparel, denotes disturbancesin your business and love affairs.For a young woman to dream of being attired in a guazy black costume,foretells she will undergo chastening sorrow and disappointment.For a young woman to dream that she meets another attired in a crimson dresswith a crepe mourning veil over her face, foretells she will be outrivaledby one she hardly considers her equal, and bitter disappointment will sourher against women generally.The dreamer interpreting the dream of apparel should be carefulto note whether the objects are looking natural. If the faces aredistorted and the light unearthly, though the colors are bright,beware; the miscarriage of some worthy plan will work you harm.There are few dreams in which the element of evil is wanting,as there are few enterprises in waking life from which the elementof chance is obviated.[16] See Clothes and Coat.
